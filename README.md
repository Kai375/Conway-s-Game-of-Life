# Conway's Game of Life
Life Game is a simulation game developed by mathematician John Conway as a model for studying the life cycle of a living organism.

This is an old project of mine made with BlueJ, the easiest way to open it is with BlueJ and clicking the 'BlueJ Project File' within the project file, or use your IDK.

# Project description:

The game is played on a giant matrix whose organs constitute possible habitats: Each site can have one of the following two states:

  1. "There is life" – a full living habitat – we will mark a full square.

  2. "There is no life" – an empty habitat – we will mark an empty square.


Conway's basic laws of genetics:

   * Birth – In any site where there is no "life" with exactly 3 living neighbors, there will be birth in the next generation. Otherwise the site remains lifeless-empty.

   * Death – In any site where there is zero "life" or a single living neighbor, death will occur in the next generation as a result of loneliness. At any site where there is "life" with four or more living neighbors, the next generation          will die as a result of a "population explosion".

   * Existence – Any site where there is "life" and has two or three living neighbors will continue to exist in the next generation.

The processes of birth, death and existence occur simultaneously at all sites and create a new state of life called a *new generation*.
